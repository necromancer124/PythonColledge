Ah! Got it 😎 — you want to add some **random “shrimp info”** in a **class-like style**, like it’s part of your README but looks like a mini Python class. Here’s how we can do it:

---

# College Code Repository

Welcome to my **college projects repository**! Here you’ll find code I’ve written for assignments, class exercises, and data experiments.

---

## 📂 What’s Inside

* **Assignments & Projects** – Python code for class exercises.
* **Data Analysis** – Examples with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
* **Graphs & Visualizations** – Histograms, boxplots, line charts, and more.
* **Python Practice** – Loops, sets, dictionaries, functions, and lambda expressions.
* **Random Fun** – Occasional turtles 🐢, shrimp 🦐, and other mysterious stuff.

---

## ⚡ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
```

2. Navigate to a folder with a project you want to run.

3. Run the Python files:

```bash
python filename.py
```

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* Occasional caffeine ☕

---

## 📝 Notes

* Code is mostly for learning and practice.
* Graphs and examples are included to demonstrate Python skills.
* You might see turtles or shrimp somewhere — treat them as honorary mascots. 🐢🦐

## 🦐 Random Shrimp Info (Class Style)

```python
class Shrimp:
    def __init__(self, name, color, size_cm):
        self.name = name
        self.color = color
        self.size_cm = size_cm
    
    def swim(self):
        print(f"{self.name} the shrimp swims gracefully!")
    
    def shrimp_fact(self):
        print(f"Fun fact: {self.name} is {self.size_cm} cm long and can change color to {self.color}!")

# Example usage
shrimp1 = Shrimp("Gary", "pink", 5)
shrimp1.swim()
shrimp1.shrimp_fact()
```

Output:

```
Gary the shrimp swims gracefully!
Fun fact: Gary is 5 cm long and can change color to pink!
```

> Treat this as a **fun mini class**, just like one of your Python exercises — random, educational, and shrimp-themed! 🦐

If you want, I can **also make a “Turtle class”** and combine it with Shrimp so the README has two silly but code-related mini classes.

Do you want me to do that?
